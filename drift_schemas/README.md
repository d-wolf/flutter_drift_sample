# DB Schema/Migration History

Every DB schema change will be dumped into this folder for migration testing. In order to create a dump file, run `dart run drift_dev schema dump lib/data/datasources/app_database.dart drift_schemas/`. Check the [link](https://drift.simonbinder.eu/docs/migrations/exports/) for more detailed information.

After a schema has been dumped, a migration test should be written. Migration test helper classes can by generated by running `dart run drift_dev schema generate drift_schemas/ test/generated_migrations/`.
